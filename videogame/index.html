            <h1>About the Game</h1>
            <p id="description">Rampage is a series of American Kaiju video games, starting with the 1986 arcade game by Midway Games. The games put you in the shoes of a giant monster, where you are tasked in each level to destroy buildings, eat people, fight the military and generally wreak havoc wherever you go. The original game presents a simple premise that carries on for the rest of the series. You choose to play as three simultaneous characters George (a King Kong-like Expy), Lizzie (a Godzilla Expy), or Ralph (a giant werewolf), humans mutated into giant monsters after exposure to radiation from the nefarious SCUM Labs. The goal of each level is to destroy each building in the given city before time runs out. Along with that, you are able to eat helpless civilians as well as destroy helicopters, tanks, cars, boats and trains.</p>
